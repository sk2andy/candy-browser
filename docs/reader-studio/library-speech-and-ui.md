# Library, speech and UI

## Library

| Piece | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ReaderLibraryRules` | Settings, progress, snapshot ordering, private-mode no-op policy |
| `ReaderLibraryStore` | Bounded local encoding and storage budget |
| `ReaderLibraryRepository` | Serialize I/O operations and return callbacks on main thread |
| `ReaderStudioScreen` | Typography, themes, alignment, save/delete, progress and speech controls |

| Invariant | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Saved snapshots | Newest 20 |
| Font scale | 0.8–1.6 |
| Reading progress | 0–1 |
| Private reader state | Fresh in-memory state; no settings, progress or snapshots persisted |

Link Peek can extract the fully loaded, committed preview WebView and save its sanitized reader
document directly for offline reading. The extraction remains bound to the preview WebView,
content revision, committed URL and source tab; stale results are rejected. Private previews never
write reader snapshots.

## Speech

| Piece | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ReaderSpeechRules` | Pure status reducer and current excerpt selection |
| `ReaderSpeechController` | Android `TextToSpeech`, chunk queue, range callbacks and cleanup |
| `ReaderDocument.speechText` | Stable title+block text projection |

- Drive state transitions through `ReaderSpeechEvent`; keep Android callbacks out of reducer logic.
- Close speech controller with screen/session lifecycle.
- Test reducer/library behavior on JVM; test store, TTS wiring and Compose semantics only where platform behavior matters.
