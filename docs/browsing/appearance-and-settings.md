# Appearance and settings

## Ownership

| Layer | Responsibility | Main code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model | Stable, persisted appearance choices and safe fallback values | `data/AppearanceSettings.kt` |
| Persistence | Global appearance preference round trips | `data/BrowserSessionStore.kt` |
| State | Observable selection and update wiring | `browser/BrowserController.kt` |
| Theme | Color schemes, Android night resources, website color-scheme preference, surface treatment, shape tokens and AMOLED surfaces | `MainActivity`, `ui/theme/MaterialBrowserTheme.kt` |
| UI | Appearance destination and live selection controls | `ui/SettingsScreen.kt` |
| Address-bar actions | Persisted ordered action layout plus drag-editor navigation under Tabs & gestures | `data/AddressBarActionLayout.kt`, `ui/AddressBarActionEditor.kt`, `BrowserSessionStore` |
| Page scroll bar | Persisted opt-in, WebView scroll metrics and draggable auto-hide overlay | `BrowserSessionStore`, `BrowserWebView`, `ui/WebViewScrollBar` |
| System bars | Status/navigation icon contrast for forced light and dark modes | `AppearanceSystemBars.kt` |
| Toppings | Local editor/import plus explicit GitHub catalog discovery; browser runtime and remote state stay controller-owned | `ui/UserscriptManagementScreen.kt`, `ui/ToppingCatalogScreen.kt` |
| App data archive | SAF launch and confirmation stay in the activity; bounded ZIP policy and cold-process restore stay in focused data/transfer owners | `MainActivity.kt`, `data/AppDataArchive*`, `AppDataTransferActivity.kt` |
| Android backup | Encrypted cloud and device-transfer inclusion policy | `res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml`, [`app-data-archive.md`](app-data-archive.md#android-auto-backup) |
| Candy Recall | Disabled-by-default local readable-page indexing and clear-on-disable behavior | `BrowserSessionStore`, `RecallRepository`, [`recall.md`](recall.md) |

| Surfaces | Clear, frosted | Clear |
| Shape | Angular, rounded, extra rounded | Rounded |

| Page translation provider | Google Translate, Yandex Translate, Kagi Translate | Google Translate |

### Surface semantics

| Surface | Browser chrome treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Clear | Opaque neutral containers with standard elevation |
| Frosted | Light translucent chrome with a live blur of browser content behind it |

Frosted exposes three persisted controls while selected:

| Control | Range | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transparency | 0–80% | 40% |
| Address-bar transparency | 0–80% | 40% |
| Blur strength | 0–100% | 60% |

## Invariants

- Appearance settings are global and persist across normal and private browsing.
- Startup animation is global and enabled by default. Disabling it skips Candy's custom animation
  on a cold launcher start and opens the address editor immediately on cold and warm launcher
  starts. External launches, activity recreation, and first-run onboarding do not force the editor
  open.
- Open home page on startup is global and disabled by default. When enabled, normal cold and warm
  launcher opens select a fresh blank tab while keeping restored tabs. An existing fresh regular
  blank tab in the active profile is reused. At the tab limit, the current tab remains unchanged.
  External links, launcher shortcuts, Site Capsules, and activity recreation keep their own
  destinations.
- Unknown stored values fall back per field; one corrupt value does not discard valid choices.
- AMOLED keeps root surfaces black. Frosted transparency does not override AMOLED black chrome.
- Frosted changes only Candy browser chrome. It does not inject styles into websites or claim backdrop refraction.
- Frosted uses WebView blur sources while browsing and Compose-backed blur sources on the new-tab page and tab overview.
- General transparency controls menus and other browser chrome; address-bar transparency independently controls the browsing and tab-overview address bars.
- Blur strength is global across frosted address chrome, menus, search suggestions and supported sheets.
- Tab options blur the visible tab-overview cards behind the menu instead of falling back to a sharp translucent surface.
- The main `…` menu shares the active browser-content blur source, including the new-tab page; its rows remain translucent so the effect stays visible.
- Bottom sheets use the general Frosted transparency setting; Privacy X-Ray also blurs the active browser content. Clear and AMOLED sheets remain opaque.
- Forced light, dark and AMOLED modes update system-bar icon contrast independently from system night mode.
- Appearance mode also selects Android's activity night resources. WebView therefore exposes the
  same effective light or dark mode to websites through `prefers-color-scheme`; AMOLED is dark,
  while System follows the device setting. Live changes reload active pages against the new Android
  theme without replacing the browser controller or persisting its in-memory private tabs. An open
  Link Peek closes before its ephemeral preview WebView is released.
- WebView algorithmic darkening is off by default. The optional **Force dark mode on websites**
  setting allows WebView to recolor sites without their own dark theme while the effective app
  appearance is dark. Websites can still respond to `prefers-color-scheme`; forced darkening may
  cause display issues by altering author-defined colors and image assets.
- Shape tokens affect browser chrome and controls; geometry owned by gesture or transition rules stays unchanged.
- Each top-level settings destination has a distinct leading icon on the settings home page.
- Candy Recall is an explicit opt-in under Protection & data. Its summary states that readable text
  from regular pages is stored locally for search and private tabs are never included. Turning it
  off clears stored Recall text; ordinary History remains governed by its own settings.
- Tabs & gestures owns the expanded address-bar action editor. The former standalone tab-button
  visibility switch is intentionally absent because **Tabs** is now an ordinary configurable action.
- The Browser setting for the draggable page scroll bar is global and defaults off. When enabled,
  native WebView scroll bars are replaced by a touch-sized thumb that appears during scrolling,
  supports direct dragging, and fades after interaction.
- Page translation provider is global and persists across regular and private browsing. Translation
  itself remains an explicit page action; no source URL or translated content is stored separately.
