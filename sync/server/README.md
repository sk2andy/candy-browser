# Candy Sync self-hosted server

Go server for Candy Sync protocols v1 and v2. V1 preserves encrypted snapshot compatibility. V2
stores workspace-scoped encrypted tab mutations and broadcasts only committed envelopes through
authenticated WebSockets.

## Security boundary

The server never receives the E2EE passphrase, workspace key, device private keys, device names,
device icon descriptors, URLs, titles, or other sync plaintext. `CANDY_SYNC_PASSPHRASE` causes an
explicit startup failure. Putting that value in Docker or server environment variables would reduce
E2EE to server-side encryption.

Device private keys and the workspace key are generated on client devices with a CSPRNG. The
immutable passphrase encrypts those client-side secrets. Losing the passphrase prevents recovery on
a new device. Protocol v1 intentionally has no passphrase-change or recovery-envelope replacement
operation.

The server does see workspace/device/entity identifiers, operations, revisions, ciphertext sizes,
timestamps, cursors, IP addresses, and request frequency. Revoking a device prevents future server
access but cannot remove plaintext already copied to that device.

## Run with Docker Compose

Copy `.env.example` to an ignored `.env`, replace both credentials, then run:

```sh
docker compose pull candy-sync
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

The public `sk2andy/candy-sync:latest` image supports Linux AMD64 and ARM64. To build the server from
the current checkout instead, run `docker compose up --build -d`.

The [publishing workflow](../../.github/workflows/publish-candy-sync-image.yml) republishes `latest`
from `main` and creates exact release tags from semantic `v*` Git tags. It disables persistent build
records and registry caches, then keeps only the five most recently pushed release tags to bound
Docker Hub storage.

Compose starts the Go service behind a Caddy gateway. The gateway exposes HTTPS on
`https://localhost:8443` and keeps HTTP on `http://localhost:8080` for explicit local-development
use. Caddy creates and renews a leaf certificate through a persistent local CA. Export its public
root certificate after the first start:

```sh
./scripts/export-local-ca.sh
```

Trust that certificate only on development clients that connect to this server. The CA private key
stays in the `candy-sync-tls-data` Docker volume; deleting that volume rotates the CA and requires
clients to trust the new root. Never export or distribute the CA private key.

On macOS, import `.local-tls/root.crt` into the login keychain and explicitly trust it for SSL in
Keychain Access. On Android, install the root as a user CA and use Candy Browser's opt-in
`userCaDebug` or `userCaRelease` variant. The standard app deliberately trusts only system CAs.
Importing a local CA is a security-sensitive client action: trust only this exported certificate,
protect the Docker volume that contains its signing key, and remove the trust when local HTTPS is
no longer needed.

For LAN access, set `CANDY_SYNC_TLS_HOST` to the exact IP address or DNS name used by clients,
`CANDY_SYNC_PUBLIC_URL` to the corresponding HTTPS URL, and `CANDY_SYNC_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` (or a
specific host address). Trusted-LAN cleartext access must additionally set
`CANDY_SYNC_PUBLIC_URL=http://...`, `CANDY_SYNC_ALLOW_HTTP=true`, and
use the HTTP port. Never expose HTTP to an untrusted network: E2EE hides tab content, but HTTP
exposes Basic credentials, bearer tokens, and traffic metadata.

SQLite lives at `/data/candy-sync.sqlite3`, uses WAL and `synchronous=FULL`, and must reside on a
local filesystem. Do not use NFS or run multiple server replicas against the same SQLite file.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `CANDY_SYNC_USERNAME` | yes | - | Bootstrap/enrollment username |
| `CANDY_SYNC_PASSWORD` | yes | - | At least 16 bytes; changing it invalidates all device tokens |
| `CANDY_SYNC_LISTEN_ADDR` | no | `:8080` | HTTP listen address |
| `CANDY_SYNC_DB_PATH` | no | `/data/candy-sync.sqlite3` | SQLite file on local storage |
| `CANDY_SYNC_PUBLIC_URL` | no | - | HTTPS public origin, or explicitly allowed HTTP origin |
| `CANDY_SYNC_ALLOW_HTTP` | no | `false` | Permit and advertise non-loopback HTTP to clients |
| `CANDY_SYNC_BIND_ADDRESS` | no | `127.0.0.1` | Host address used by the supplied Compose port mapping |
| `CANDY_SYNC_PORT` | no | `8080` | Host port for the optional HTTP gateway |
| `CANDY_SYNC_TLS_HOST` | no | `localhost` | Exact DNS name or IP address included in the local TLS certificate |
| `CANDY_SYNC_TLS_PORT` | no | `8443` | Host port for the HTTPS gateway |
| `CANDY_SYNC_TOKEN_TTL` | no | `0` | Device token TTL; `0` means until revocation |
| `CANDY_SYNC_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | no | `1048576` | Request body limit |
| `CANDY_SYNC_MAX_BATCH` | no | `250` | Push/pull batch limit |
| `CANDY_SYNC_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |
| `CANDY_SYNC_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` | no | empty | Trusted reverse-proxy header for per-client Basic-auth limits |

Username/password are used for authenticated bootstrap and enrollment. The client exchanges them for
a random, device-scoped bearer token and must not persist the password. The database stores only a
keyed token hash. Changing the configured username or password invalidates existing tokens.

Basic-auth attempts are limited per client address. The supplied Caddy gateway is the only
published service and overwrites `X-Forwarded-For`; the Go service is reachable only inside the
Compose network. Another reverse proxy must provide the same boundary. Without a trusted proxy, leave
`CANDY_SYNC_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` empty. Missing or malformed header values fall back
to the transport peer.

## API

| Method | Path | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/candy-sync` | none |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | none |
| `GET` | `/readyz` | none |
| `GET` | `/v1/bootstrap` | Basic |
| `POST` | `/v1/devices` | Basic |
| `GET` | `/v1/devices` | Bearer |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/devices/{id}` | Basic re-authentication |
| `POST` | `/v1/sync/push` | Bearer + `Idempotency-Key` |
| `GET` | `/v1/sync/pull?after={cursor}` | Bearer |
| `POST` | `/v1/sync/ack` | Bearer |
| `GET` | `/v1/sync/snapshot` | Bearer |
| `PUT` | `/v1/devices/{targetId}/tabs` | active device Bearer + `Idempotency-Key` |
| `POST` | `/v2/sync/push` | Bearer + `Idempotency-Key` |
| `GET` | `/v2/sync/pull?after={cursor}` | Bearer |
| `POST` | `/v2/realtime/tickets` | Bearer |
| `GET` | `/v2/realtime?ticket={singleUseTicket}` | single-use ticket, then WebSocket |

API errors use `application/problem+json`. Revisions are decimal strings to avoid JavaScript integer
loss. Cursors are opaque `serverEpoch.sequence` values. A cursor from another epoch or ahead of the
database returns `410 cursor_reset`; clients must fetch a full encrypted snapshot.

Enrollment requires an encrypted name and encrypted device-icon descriptor. Device listing returns
both opaque envelopes. Databases migrated from the pre-icon schema may return `encryptedIcon: null`
for legacy rows; new enrollment always requires the field.

Every push is one SQLite transaction. Duplicate `(deviceId, changeId)` with identical encrypted
envelope is a successful retry; different content returns `409 idempotency_conflict`. Shared objects
and tab snapshots use compare-and-swap revisions.

Any active workspace device may update another active device's synced tab profile.
The bearer-authenticated writer remains in change metadata as `deviceId`; the target
profile is `entityId`. This is auditable routing metadata only—the payload stays E2EE.

V2 accepts exactly one encrypted tab delta per push. Bearer authentication determines account,
workspace, and writer device; request metadata must match it. Each target profile uses CAS revision
ordering. Server commits envelope and workspace cursor before fan-out. Realtime queues are bounded;
slow clients are disconnected and recover through ordered v2 pull. Device revocation disconnects
its current sockets. Sender is included in fan-out so stream delivery can confirm a commit whose
HTTP response was lost.

First committed v2 delta atomically raises that workspace's protocol floor. All later v1 tab writes
fail with `409 protocol_upgrade_required`, while v1 reads remain usable. V1 tab writes accepted
before promotion also update v2's CAS baseline, and migration seeds that baseline from existing v1
snapshots. This prevents mixed writers from creating two different successors to one revision.

V2 tickets expire after 45 seconds and are consumed once. The ticket query value is deliberately
short-lived because browser WebSocket APIs cannot attach an Authorization header. Reverse proxies
must avoid query-string access logs for `/v2/realtime`.

Migration 0003 creates account/workspace membership and v2-scoped storage. Current environment Basic
credentials still select one default account/workspace. Protocol v1 intentionally remains the
single-default-workspace compatibility API; it must not be exposed to future non-default accounts.
V2 bearer authentication already carries account, workspace, and device identity, and every v2 store
query scopes by workspace. Full account provisioning, tenant-aware v1 replacement, and shared-workspace
key lifecycle are reserved for a later iteration.

## Tests

Local toolchain:

```sh
go test -count=1 ./...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
```

Docker-only reproducible gate:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
./scripts/test-compose-https.sh
```

The container test target downloads pinned Go modules, runs all tests with the race detector, and
runs `go vet`. It requires no database, port, credentials, or other manual setup.

## Backup and restore

Use a SQLite-consistent backup, not a live filesystem copy that omits WAL contents. Stop the server
before a simple file copy. A restored older database must receive a new server epoch before clients
resume; until a dedicated restore command exists, create a fresh workspace and encrypted full sync.
